	create new simple java project
	add selenium libs
		project-properties-External jar
		
	add package
	add empty main class

	add path driver for chrome browser hardcoded
		System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", 
		"D:/JavaProjects/selenium-java-3.3.1/chromedriver.exe");
		
		or better put driver to project root and
	add path driver for chrome browser self navigate to project root drivers folder
		System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", 
		System.getProperty("user.dir")+"/drivers/chromedriver.exe");
	
	
	add xpath extension to chrome by adding crx file to config
	
	so app starting will be like 
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// add path driver for chrome browser self navigate to project root lib
		// folder
		System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/drivers/chromedriver.exe");

		// The main interface to use for testing, which represents an idealised
		// web browser.
		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		
		ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
		chromeOptions.addExtensions(new File(System.getProperty("user.dir") + "/drivers/xpath.crx"));

		DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.chrome();
		capabilities.setCapability(ChromeOptions.CAPABILITY, chromeOptions);
		driver = new ChromeDriver(capabilities);

		// open yahoo.com
		driver.get("http://yahoo.com");

		driver.manage().window().maximize();
	
	
		To create .crx file for any extension install the extension in Google Chrome
		browser from Chrome Web Store.
		
		Access the local folder path of chrome extension and copy the complete path
		C:\Users\MYUSER\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
		Data\Default\Extensions\fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm\0.8.4.9_0.
		
		Enable Developer mode on Chrome Extension page.
		
		Click on Pack Extension button and enter the copied local folder path of your
		desired extension in Extension Root Directory field.
		
		Click on Pack Extension button in pop up and verify the .crx file at location
		mentioned in confirmation pop up.

////// TestNG /////////////

	in eclipse click help-> eclipse market place-> find-> testng

	create new class
	create new test by using annotation @Test and add TestNG libs to project
		
	@Test - mark a class or a method as part of the test.
	when test runs - xml file automatically created at temp
	D:\Users\erik\AppData\Local\Temp\testng-eclipse--1242689959
	to create own test suite - create xml file on the root and configure
	which tests in which order to be run and what amount of 
	information to be in the output
	(verbose parameter responsible for amount of info in the output, 
	the bigger number - more info)

	testNG configuration annotations
	@BeforeSuite: The annotated method will be run before all tests in this
	suite have run.
	@AfterSuite: The annotated method will be run after all tests in this
	suite have run.
	@BeforeTest: The annotated method will be run before any test method
	belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run.
	@AfterTest: The annotated method will be run after all the test methods
	belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag have run.
	@BeforeGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run
	before. This method is guaranteed to run shortly before the first test
	method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.
	@AfterGroups: The list of groups that this configuration method will run
	after. This method is guaranteed to run shortly after the last test
	method that belongs to any of these groups is invoked.
	@BeforeClass: The annotated method will be run before the first test
	method in the current class is invoked.
	@AfterClass: The annotated method will be run after all the test methods
	in the current class have been run.
	@BeforeMethod: The annotated method will be run before each test method.
	@AfterMethod: The annotated method will be run after each test method.

	if needed to skip some test - just add throw new SkipException("someText")
	to test method
		@Test
		public void signUpViaFacebook() {
			System.out.println("SignUp via Facebook");
			throw new SkipException("Facebook functionality is not supported");
		}
		
	to create priority order of tests execution inside one class add (priority=value)
	to annotation @Test like 
		@Test(priority=1) 
	lower priorities will be scheduled first
	
	if we need some tests execution to be depended from successful execution of 
	some previous tests - we use depenendsOnMethods, like 
		@Test(dependsOnMethods = { "login" }) 
	or 
		@Test(priority = 2, dependsOnMethods = { "login" }) 
	dependsOnMethods - The list of methods this method depends on. There is
	no guarantee on the order on which the methods depended upon will be run,
	but you are guaranteed that all these methods will be run before the test
	method that contains this annotation is run. Furthermore, if any of these
	methods was not a SUCCESS, this test method will not be run and will be
	flagged as a SKIP. If some of these methods have been overloaded, all the
	overloaded versions will be run.
